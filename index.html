                        Great design is more than just pixel perfect sites, it's an experience yet to be experienced. We iterate in our design process until we are sure this experience feels natural to the end users and helps them solve their goal in the most direct, easy and expected way possible.

                        A firm believer in the minimalist approach to software development pote prefers to solve the right problem in the most straightforward way possible. He regularly embarrasses himself by playing music, soccer, practicing martial arts and advocating the use of bowties.

                        Gentleman by day, philosopher by night, pervert by choice, rebel by fate: elcuervo is a passionate human who strives to make the world a better place in everything he does. His open source contributions put the rest of us to shame as he is a prolific creator of tools for a variety of languages; he loves photography and podcasting, as well as fancy whiskey.

                        Santiago has a unique blend of imagination, taste, pragmatism and attention to detail that make him one of the most exceptional designers you will ever work with, his views towards design go beyond mere aesthetics: he will evaluate everything from the real user needs to your brand identity, creating coherent design resources that are just a joy to work with. He'll do it all before lunch too, it'd be annyoing if it wasn't so brilliant.

                        When not at work Santiago attempts to catalogue the entirety of human pop culture in his brain, with remarkable success.

                        Under his outer shell of extreme pragmatism and solid, cold-blooded software engineering, Alf hides a passion for free software and the open web that fuels his desire to keep learning new technologies, making him an incredibly versatile developer. When out of the office he is also a fan of good scotch, loves to play some soccer and chill out in beach towns.

                        Foca has been writing code for a long time—each line a little worse than the one before. He keeps doing it, hoping that the trend will reverse itself at some point. Outside of work, he enjoys board games, reading, watching movies, and coding on random things for fun.

                        If we consider that once we won't be alive anymore, it's very important to ask ourselves: "What do I want to accomplish in life?", "What do I want to do in life?", "What's important for me?". For diablo it's biking, photography, philosophy, and obviously be inmersed in code
